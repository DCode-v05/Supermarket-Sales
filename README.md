# 🛒 Supermarket Sales – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the **Supermarket Sales** dataset.  
The objective is to understand the behavior of sales, customer types, gross income, and product performance using various visualizations.

## 📊 Project Overview

In this project, I:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Rounded off numerical values for better readability
- Encoded gender values for uniformity
- Performed descriptive statistics
- Segregated numerical and categorical features
- Created insightful plots to understand how various features relate to **COGS** (Cost of Goods Sold) and **Gross Income**
